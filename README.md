For our assignment we have been tasked with the creation of a website and mobile app for the fictional organisation: Empower the Nation.

Empower the nation is an organisation whose goal is to educate and upskill impoverished people on a budget, helping people make a living by making them more employable and 
allowing for them to be paid at a higher rate, specifically targeted at domestic workers and gardeners. As this is an institution for learning and upskilling, a lot of design 
choices attempt to display visuals relating to education and progress.

To use this app, download it from github, Unzip the file, open it in VS Code and using npm and expo go in the terminal on VS code you can run the app on your device.

Here is the link to the App Demonstration: https://youtu.be/g7B6nSocN_k
